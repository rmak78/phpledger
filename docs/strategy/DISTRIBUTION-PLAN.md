# Distribution plan

Drafted 15 September 2026 from the [decision register](DECISION-REGISTER.md) (B2, A1, A2, C7, C8) and the [Pakistan market](PAKISTAN-MARKET.md) findings. Distribution is treated as a product milestone with owners and gates, not as marketing. Channel names and mechanics were checked on the date above; re-verify submission processes before acting. Nothing here is a claim that any channel is live.

**Update, 19 September 2026.** 1.0.0 is published on GitHub Releases only. The owner added GHCR and CasaOS to Tier 2, put npm, Homebrew, Bitnami and DigitalOcean on a dated future roadmap (Tier 3b below), and asked that installations report their installation to phpledger.com (principle 4 is amended accordingly). The per-release sequence and every channel's upgrade path are in the [release protocol](../RELEASE-PROTOCOL.md); the platform work under distribution (table prefix, database engines, plugins, users) is in the [platform roadmap](PLATFORM-ROADMAP.md).

## Principles

1. **Install counts are a distribution outcome.** Akaunting's reach came from being one click away inside hosting panels; FrontAccounting's decline tracks its absence from them.
2. **The person who installs is not the person who uses it.** For the target tier the installer is an accountant, a software house or a hosting reseller (see A2). Every channel below is chosen for that person.
3. **Do not distribute a half product.** Broad listing before AR/AP and the FBR client exist would create a first impression of "ledger with no receivables" and a support load with no revenue. Cheap, developer-facing channels go first; mass channels wait for the trader-complete release.
4. **No phone-home for licensing, ever.** Nothing is ever gated on contacting phpledger.com. *Amended 19 September 2026 (owner):* installations send an installation notice (on by default, anonymous: random installation ID, version, channel, runtime and time) and may optionally register the owner's name, email, site and company. The update check reuses the installation ID. Both can be switched off, and every field is published on the website privacy page. This is how installs get counted.
5. **Every channel needs an upgrade path, not just an install path.** The in-app updater (signed release manifest, pre-upgrade backup, migration check, rollback) is the retention feature and ships before the mass channels open.

## Channels

| Tier | Channel | Why | What it requires from us | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Hosting panels | **Softaculous** (cPanel, DirectAdmin, Plesk, CyberPanel, ~thousands of hosts) | The single largest source of PHP-app installs on shared hosting; AGPL qualifies for the free library. Softaculous builds the official package on request; a custom package (info.xml, install.xml, install.php, upgrade.php, zipped release) can be given to individual hosts immediately. | A release zip with a non-interactive install (config from parameters, database from parameters, admin from parameters); an upgrade script; PHP 8.2 floor; a demo URL and screenshots. | Trader-complete release (AR, AP, FBR client). |
| 1 | **Installatron** | Second panel installer; strong on Plesk and DirectAdmin. | Same package discipline as Softaculous; application submission through Installatron. | Same. |
| 1 | **Pakistani cPanel hosts** as direct partners | The panel installer is generic; a local host preloading the custom package and naming PHP Ledger in its plans is the reseller relationship in miniature. Five hosts cover most of the Pakistani shared-hosting market. | The custom Softaculous package plus a one-page partner offer (co-marketing, first-line support boundary). | Same; owner-led outreach through existing networks. |
| 2 — Self-host ecosystem | **Container image + compose** (`ghcr.io/phpledger/phpledger`, mirrored to Docker Hub `phpledger/phpledger`) | Baseline for every other Tier-2 channel; what a software house or agency actually runs. GHCR needs no new account; Docker Hub is where people search. | Production image built from the release ZIP, multi-arch, health check, non-root, read-only code layer, documented env, tagged per release; `compose.production.yaml` with MySQL 8.4. The current `Dockerfile` is a development and CI image and is not this product. | Now (the repo already ships compose files). |
| 2 | **Managed open-source hosts: Elestio, PikaPods, Hossted** | They host open-source apps for a monthly fee and share revenue with the project (PikaPods and Elestio both pay maintainers). Zero operations for us, and it gives non-technical accountants a "hosted PHP Ledger" without us running a SaaS. | The Docker image; a listing request; a maintainer account for the revenue share. | Docker image plus first stable tag. |
| 2 | **App platforms: Cloudron, YunoHost, CapRover, Coolify, Umbrel, Unraid Community Apps, TrueNAS apps, Portainer templates, CasaOS** | Each is a self-hoster community with its own catalogue; AGPL is accepted by all. | A package manifest per platform (most are thin wrappers around the Docker image); YunoHost and Cloudron need their own packaging and a maintainer. | After Docker image; low effort each, do in a batch. |
| 3 — Registries and releases | **GitHub Releases** (exists) | Already the canonical download. | Signed checksums; release notes that state scope honestly (existing policy). | Now. |
| 3 | **Packagist** (`composer create-project phpledger/phpledger`) | How PHP developers and software houses expect to obtain a PHP application. | `composer.json` metadata, a `create-project` layout, tagged releases. | Now. |
| 3b — Future registries | **DigitalOcean Marketplace 1-Click** | One-click droplet for agencies and software houses already on DigitalOcean; the marketplace lists open-source apps free of charge (verify at submission). | A Packer-built droplet image with Docker and `compose.production.yaml`, a first-boot script for domain and TLS, DigitalOcean's image checks passing, listing copy from the media kit. | After 1.2, once the container image has shipped two releases. |
| 3b | **Bitnami** | Curated catalogue (Broadcom) that reaches enterprise VM and Kubernetes users. | Not self-service: a request through Bitnami's application-request process with the image, environment table and demo. If accepted, adapt to their container conventions. | After DigitalOcean; owner-led request, no code until accepted. |
| 3b | **npm** | The application is PHP, so npm carries no application package. Two useful packages: `create-phpledger` (a scaffolder that downloads the release and writes a production compose file) and `@phpledger/api-client` (a typed client for the read API and MCP, shared with the planned Windows and Android clients). | New `clients/js/` package; provenance-signed publishes from CI on tag. The existing private `package.json` stays a Tailwind build manifest. | Scaffolder after DigitalOcean; client with the native clients. |
| 3b | **Homebrew** | macOS and Linux users who want a local copy without a server. | A tap `phpledger/homebrew-tap` whose formula installs the release and a `phpledger` launcher (start, stop, backup) over PHP's built-in server and SQLite. A formula cannot reasonably require a MySQL server, so this waits for the SQLite work. | With the Windows desktop bundle. |
| 3 | **Windows desktop bundle** (portable PHP 8.2 + MariaDB + PHP Ledger, one installer, runs on localhost) | The accountant's office computer is the only computer in the chain (12% household ownership). A Windows bundle is the cheapest "desktop app" and satisfies the owner's desktop intent without native code; the same bundle becomes the LAN server for a shop. | Build script, signed installer, start/stop tray, backup to a folder, update through the in-app updater. | Trader-complete release. |
| 4 — Discovery | **awesome-selfhosted, selfh.st, OpenAlternative, AlternativeTo, SourceForge mirror, Product Hunt, r/selfhosted, Show HN** | Where "open source accounting" searches land; SourceForge specifically because FrontAccounting's users live there. | Listings need a stable release, screenshots, a demo, and honest capability wording. | Trader-complete release; one launch week, not a trickle. |
| 4 | **"Alternative to" pages on phpledger.com** | Search intent is comparative: Akaunting alternative, QuickBooks Pakistan, Peachtree replacement, FBR digital invoicing software. | Pages that state the comparison truthfully, including what we lack. | Owner's SEO workstream (already high priority). |
| 5 — Pakistan channel | **Tax consultants and accounting firms** (ICAP, ICMAP, Pakistan Tax Bar members) | They operate the books for most registered SMEs and are the buyer of the consultant edition. | Multi-company installation guide; Annex-A/C/I exports; a short "for practitioners" page; consultant edition pricing when declared. | AR/AP plus FBR client. |
| 5 | **Training institutes teaching Peachtree/QuickBooks/Tally** (IPATS, Mirchawala, Careervision and similar) | Their graduates become the accountants who choose software. Free course material with PHP Ledger replaces a decade-old pirated Peachtree in the curriculum. | A teaching pack: sample company, exercises, certificate of completion. | Trader-complete release. |
| 5 | **Software houses currently selling white-labelled PHP ERPs** | Same hosting and price niche; they could ship PHP Ledger under a partner badge instead of a script they cannot maintain. | Partner programme: implementation training, badge, lead sharing, boundaries on branding (trademark). | After first five real installations (C9); partner programme drafted then. |
| 5 | **P@SHA and the owner's existing networks** | Warm introductions to software houses and hosts. | Nothing new; use the current outreach. | Now. |
| 6 — Retention | **In-app updater** | Every channel above becomes a dead install without upgrades; the updater is also the install counter. | Signed release manifest; pre-upgrade backup; migration checks (exist); rollback; opt-in anonymous version ping. | Before Tier 1 opens. |

## Future registries roadmap (Tier 3b)

| Step | Channel | Prerequisite | Evidence that it is open |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | DigitalOcean 1-Click | Container image shipped for two releases without an image-only defect; owner creates the vendor account | Listing live; a fresh droplet installs and upgrades one release |
| 2 | Bitnami request | Step 1 image conventions (non-root, health check, environment table) | Request filed; outcome recorded here |
| 3 | npm `create-phpledger` | Release feed live | Scaffolder produces a working compose install of the current release |
| 4 | Homebrew tap and npm API client | SQLite support; native-client API contract | `brew install` then `brew upgrade` across one release; client used by one native client |

Each step adds a decision-register line when it starts and a row to the release protocol's channel table when it opens.

## Sequence

| Phase | When | Channels opened | Why this order |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Developer channels | Now, alongside AR/AP work | GHCR and Docker Hub image and compose; Packagist; GitHub Releases with checksums; Elestio/PikaPods/Hossted listing requests; Portainer/CapRover/Coolify manifests | Cheap, no support load, reaches the software houses and agencies who are the realistic early installers. Managed hosts start paying revenue share as soon as anyone deploys. |
| 1 — Trader-complete release | When AR, AP and the FBR digital-invoicing client pass their gates (the register's Layer 1) | In-app updater; Softaculous request and custom package; Installatron; Pakistani host partners; Windows bundle; Cloudron/YunoHost packages; directory listings and one launch week; practitioner page | Mass channels open only for a product a trader can run a business on. |
| 2 — Channel programme | After five real businesses and one accountant sign-off (C9) | Partner programme for software houses; training-institute pack; consultant edition (when declared) | Partners need a proven product and a support boundary before they will carry it. |
| 3 — Regional | With each Middle East adapter (UAE, KSA, Oman) | Same channels, plus regional hosts and Arabic listings | Follows the tax-adapter sequence in the register (A7). |

## Measurement

The count comes from the installation notice (owner decision, 19 September 2026) and from channels that report:

- Installation notices: one per new installation, with the random installation ID, version, channel and runtime; optional registrations add who installed. Later update checks carrying the same ID give the "active installs" number.
- Docker Hub pulls; Packagist installs; GitHub release downloads (already available).
- Softaculous publishes per-script install counts; Installatron reports to the vendor.
- Managed-host deployments (Elestio, PikaPods report to maintainers).
- Partner-reported installations under the partner programme.

Targets are set by the owner; the register's 90-day target (five real businesses, one accountant sign-off) precedes any install target. A suggested first install target after Phase 1: 100 active installs reporting through the update check within six months of the trader-complete release, with at least 20 in Pakistan.

## Costs and owners

| Item | Owner | Cost basis |
|---|---|---|
| Docker image, Packagist, release signing, manifests | Technical lead | Development time only |
| Softaculous/Installatron packages and submissions | Technical lead | Development time; no listing fee for open-source scripts (verify at submission) |
| Windows bundle | Technical lead | Development time plus a code-signing certificate |
| Managed-host listings | Owner | Free; revenue share inbound |
| Host partnerships, P@SHA outreach, training institutes | Owner | Time; co-marketing collateral |
| Partner programme | Owner + technical lead | Training material, badge, support boundary; priced after the first five installations |
| Directory listings, launch week | Owner (SEO workstream) | Time |

## Open checks before Phase 1

- Softaculous official inclusion process and turnaround (custom packages are documented; official library inclusion is by request).
- Whether Pakistani hosts run Softaculous or Installatron (or both) and which panel versions.
- Code-signing certificate for the Windows bundle.
- Revenue-share terms at Elestio and PikaPods at the time of listing.
